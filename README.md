# Human-Face-Thermal-Imaging-Dataset
This project provides human (face) thermography-thermal comfort data collected in air-conditioned environments under different genders, ages (18-60 years), and locations (Shandong Province, China). 
The Human-Face-Thermal-Imaging-Dataset is divided into a training set and a test set, with the training set comprising 544 images and the test set containing 93 images, predominantly with neutral senses. 
The dataset will be made publicly available to all researchers upon acceptance of the thesis paper.
